## Project Context

The DFlow API client is a Rust library that provides seamless access to various DFlow APIs. The codebase is written in Rust and is designed for high performance and reliability. It is structured to offer robust, modular tooling for developers building on Solana.

## Coding Guidelines

- **Rust & Architecture:**

  - Follow best practices for Rust development, ensuring clear separation of concerns and modularity.
  - Organize functionality into logical modules.
  - Leverage Rust’s type system for maximum safety and reliability.

- **Rust & Code Quality:**

  - Enforce strict type safety with well-defined structs, enums, and traits.
  - Always use descriptive names for variables, functions, and types, avoiding abbreviations.
  - Use `let` and `const` for immutability by default, opting for `mut` only when reassignment is necessary.
  - Prefer the use of `Result<T, E>` and `Option<T>` for error handling over panics. Always return errors with proper context.
  - Avoid unnecessary cloning. Use references where possible to improve performance.

- **Concurrency & Asynchronous Patterns:**

  - Leverage Rust’s async/await for asynchronous operations.
  - Ensure that all async functions return `Result` or `Option` for proper error handling.
  - Use `tokio` for async runtimes, ensuring proper error propagation and handling with `try/catch`-like patterns.

- **Documentation & Comments:**

  - Use `///` for public documentation, providing clear and concise explanations for methods, structs, and modules.
  - Include usage examples, especially for complex or nuanced functionality, in the `/examples` directory.
  - Add comments for critical areas of code where logic might not be immediately obvious or where performance considerations are involved.

- **Project Tools & Conventions:**

  - Use `cargo` for dependency management, ensuring the `Cargo.toml` is properly updated for project dependencies.
  - Ensure the code is modular, testable, and maintainable. Consider using the Rust module system to organize features logically.
  - Write unit and integration tests using `cargo test` for critical components to guarantee reliable performance.
  - Follow Rust’s idioms and conventions for consistency and readability across the codebase.
  - Run `rustfmt` and `clippy` regularly to ensure consistent formatting and to catch potential issues early.

- **Error Handling:**

  - All error handling in the DFlow client should utilize the custom `Result<T>` type, which uses `DflowError` for error management:

    ```rust
    /// A handy type alias for handling results across the DFlow SDK
    pub type Result<T> = std::result::Result<T, DflowError>;
    ```

  - The `DflowError` type should be used to wrap all errors, providing a consistent and detailed error handling strategy across the client lib.
  - Ensure all errors are clearly documented and include useful context where necessary.
